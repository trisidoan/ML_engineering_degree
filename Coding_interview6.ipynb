    "The Tower Hopper problem gives us an array of values representing heights that express how far we can jump from a certain tower, and asks whether there's a way to get from tower[0] (0 indexed) to outside of the array.\n",

    "For ex, if we have towers = [4, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], we can jump from towers[0] to towers[4] and then outside of the bounds of the array. Or we could jump from towers[0] to towers[1] to towers[4] and then out of the array. But if we had towers = [4, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0], there would be no way to hop out of the array and we should return False."
