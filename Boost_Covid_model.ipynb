    "### Boost Model Accuracy of Imbalanced COVID-19 Mortality Prediction Using GAN-based Oversampling Technique.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The data and the core model for this article are considered from the recent study (July 2020) on “COVID-19 Patient Health Prediction Using Boosted Random Forest Algorithm” by Celestine Iwendi, Ali Kashif Bashir, Atharva Peshkar. et al. This study used the Random Forest algorithm boosted by the AdaBoost model and predicted the mortality of individual patients with 94% accuracy. In this article, the same model and model parameters were considered to clearly analyze the improvement of existing model accuracies by using GAN- based Oversampling Technique."
