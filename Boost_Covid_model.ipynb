    "### Boost Model Accuracy of Imbalanced COVID-19 Mortality Prediction Using GAN-based Oversampling Technique.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The data and the core model for this article are considered from the recent study (July 2020) on “COVID-19 Patient Health Prediction Using Boosted Random Forest Algorithm” by Celestine Iwendi, Ali Kashif Bashir, Atharva Peshkar. et al. This study used the Random Forest algorithm boosted by the AdaBoost model and predicted the mortality of individual patients with 94% accuracy. In this article, the same model and model parameters were considered to clearly analyze the improvement of existing model accuracies by using GAN- based Oversampling Technique."

    "The data used in studies were trained using 222 patient records with 13 features. The data is biased as 159(72%) cases belong to the class `0′ or ‘recovered’. Due to its skewed nature, various undersampling/oversampling techniques can be applied to the data. The problem of skewness data could lead to overfitting of the prediction model. To overcome this limitation many studies have implemented the use of oversampling methods to provide a balance to the dataset, leading to more accurate model training. Oversampling is a technique for compensating the imbalance of a dataset, by increasing the number of samples within the minority data. Conventional methods include Random Oversampling (ROS), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and others can be applied"

    "Recently, a machine learning model for developing a generative network based on an adversarial learning concept, namely the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), has been proposed. The characteristic of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) makes it easily applicable to oversampling studies since the nature of the neural network developed based on adversarial training allows artificial data to be made that is similar to the original data. Oversampling based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) overcomes the limitations of conventional methods, such as overfitting, and allows the development of a highly accurate prediction model of imbalanced data."
